# ============================================================================
# apply_tenant_address_fix.ps1 — adds an "Address" field to Tenants
#
# HOW TO USE:
#   1. Put this file AND "tenant_address.patch" into the main folder of your
#      oneaccounts-property-management project (the folder that has
#      "backend" and "frontend" folders inside it).
#   2. IMPORTANT: run the SQL migration (005_add_tenant_address.sql) in
#      Supabase SQL Editor FIRST, before running this script. The frontend
#      code will show a broken "Address" field if the database column
#      doesn't exist yet.
#   3. Open PowerShell in that project folder.
#   4. Run:
#      powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File apply_tenant_address_fix.ps1
#
# WHAT IT DOES, IN ORDER:
#   1. Makes sure you're in the right folder.
#   2. Pulls the latest code from GitHub (so you're up to date first).
#   3. Checks the patch will apply cleanly (a "dry run" — nothing is changed
#      by this step, it just checks).
#   4. Applies the patch (this is when files actually change).
#   5. Commits and pushes the change to GitHub, which will trigger Vercel
#      to redeploy your frontend automatically.
#
# If anything goes wrong at any step, the script stops and tells you —
# it will NOT push a broken/partial change.
