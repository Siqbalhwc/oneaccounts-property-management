# apply_gl_layout_print_fix.ps1
# General Ledger page tidy-up, based on your feedback:
#  1. Date (From/To) filters moved up next to the page heading/description,
#     instead of taking their own row in the filter card.
#  2. Added a "Print" button (top right, next to the date filters) --
#     reuses the same print system already used on the Reports page
#     (letterhead header, filters hidden, clean printable table).
#  3. The remaining filters -- Account, Building, Apartment, Tenant --
#     now sit in a single row instead of two.
#
# Code only -- no SQL migration needed for this one.
